# Nujel.net

This repo contains some work for the website describing Nujel, it also contains
an SSG written in Nujel (will be extracted in future versions, for now it is more
convenient to have content/ssg in the same repo).

The SSG also helps in testing the module system as well as general stand alone
application development with Nujel.

It is still **very** early in development, so pretty much nothing works, if you
do still intend to give it a spin you probably need the latest Nujel version from
the `develop` branch and then just running `nujel main.nuj` should do the trick
and generate some files in `deploy/`.
