<p>Finally added a news section, which might not be that exciting but this is actually the culmination of a lot of backend work in the SSG, since we can now automatically search through all content and show a summarized list and link to the detailed version, residing at a canonical URL. By now the entire template system has been rewritten in a more component oriented style, which should soon have a JSX like notation which can be used throughout the codebase. This is mainly because I am not a huge fan of Markdown, and would greatly prefer something like JSX.</p>
