<h1>The Nujel reference</h1>
<p>
    This is an experiment in generating a usable reference using the builtin reflection abilities,
    they will be pretty terrible at first, but hopefully will improve over time in quality.
</p>
<p>
    The ones that are categorized should hopefully have some passable documentation attached, the unsorted rest will hopefully shrink over time as I document the standard library.
</p>
<p>
    All the documentation here is generated by parsing the built-in documentation and some additional metadata. All the examples seen here are also just pretty printed unit tests which are run on every commit.
</p>

<div class="category-list">
{{
    (def cats {})
    (-> (symbol-table)
        (map resolve-or-nil)
        (for-each (fn (a) (tree/set! cats (closure/cat a) #t))))
    (-> (tree/keys cats)
        (sort (fn (a b) (< (string a) (string b))))
        (map (fn (a) (component :CategoryNavigation {:category a})))
        (join ""))
                            }}
</div>
