<h1>Comments</h1>
<p>Comments use Scheme syntax, and some SRFI's have been implemented directly.</p>
<pre>
; A single semicolon comments out everything until the next line
(+ 1 #;2 3) ; You can use #; to comment out the following form, should be SRFI-62 compatible!
; => 4
#|
 | Nujel also allows for SRFI-30 like nested Multi-line comments
 |#
[comment [println "A message, never to be printed."]] ; Nujel also has a comment macro, this however returns #nil unlike #;
</pre>

<p>Apart from that it is recommended to use a single <code>;</code> at the end of a line to comment whatever is happening on that particular line.</p>

<p>If however you would like to comment a bigger section of code you should put 2 <code>;;</code> at the beginning of the line.</p>

<p>For top-level comments describing the entire file try and use 3 <code>;;;</code> at the beginning of the lines.</p>

<p>The comment macro is mostly useful for usage with <code>nujel-mode</code> since you can easily evaluate commented out forms. Beware however that everything within a comment macro needs to be a valid Nujel S-Expression!</p>

<p>This is in accordance with <i>Scheme</i>, <i>Common Lisp</i> as well as <i>Clojure</i> best practices.</p>
