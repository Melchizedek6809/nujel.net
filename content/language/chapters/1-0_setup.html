<h1>Setup</h1>
<p>I would highly recommend running Nujel in the background while reading this book, so you can experiment yourself with the various snippets provided. To install Nujel you can follow the instructions provided in the file from the root of the repository.</p>

<p>Currently there are no official binaries provided, but compiling Nujel shoule be very simple since you only need a C Compiler and <code>make</code>, there are no other dependencies.</p>

<h2>Text Editor</h2>
<p>If you use Emacs you can try using <a href="https://github.com/Melchizedek6809/nujel-mode">nujel-mode</a>, otherwise you can try using <i>Scheme</i> or <i>Clojure</i> modes since they should work reasonably well with Nujel.</p>

<h2>Interactive Environment</h2>
<p>You can run Nujel with <code>rlwrap</code> in order to get proper readline support, <code>nujel-mode</code> supports running Nujel interactively as well.</p>
