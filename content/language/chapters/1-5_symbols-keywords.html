<h1>Symbols / Keywords</h1>

<p>Keywords have to start, or end, with a single <code>:</code> character and are self-evaluating. They are a distinct type from symbols but can be easily converted.</p>

<p>Regarding their usage, keywords should be used when the keyword itself is the value to be used, symbols should be used to give a label to another value.</p>

<pre class="source source-nujel">
:asd ; A keyword
; => :asd

asd: ; Another keyword
; => asd:

[= asd: :asd] ; It doesn't matter where we put the colon
; => #t

[= :asd [symbol->keyword 'asd]]
; => #t
</pre>
