<h1>Numbers</h1>

<p>Nujel supports normal decimal notation and treats <code>,</code>  and <code>_</code> as whitespace characters so you can split big numbers for increased legibility.  There is also special syntax for binary, octal and hexadecimal literals. Scientific notation is <b>not</b> supported.</p>

<pre>
9 ; probably not that suprising
; => 9

100,0; possible, but probably shouldn't be commited that way
; => 1000

1,0,0,0; also a possibility...
; => 1000

1,000 ; much better!
; => 1000

1_000 ; Underscore is also workable, although mostly preferrable for non decimal literals
; => 1000

#b10000 ; This way we can write binary literals
; => 16

#b0001_0000 ; Especially here does it become useful that we can use _ and , to split our literal wherever we choose
; => 16

#x12_34 ; Also helps for hex literals
; => 4660

#o10 ; Octal literals are also possible
; => 8

0x123 ; Using an 0x prefix does NOT work and results in a read error being thrown
; => :read-error

-100 ; You can also write negative numbers
</pre>
