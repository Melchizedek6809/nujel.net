<h1>Functions</h1>
<p>Functions use <code>defn</code> and <code>fn</code>, just like <i>Clojure</i>, however in Nujel we can freely choose whether we want to use brackets or parentheses.</p>

<h3>1. Defining functions</h3>
<p>Defining a function is best done with the <code>[defn]</code> macro if it is named, or <code>[fn]</code> for anonymous functions.</p>
{{ [component :Nujel #nil
"[defn double [α] [* 2 α]]
[double 2] ; => 4

[def double [fn [b] [* 2 b]]]
[double 2] ; => 4"] }}

<h3>2. Defining functions with a rest argument</h3>
<p>In order to define a function that has a certain number of named arguments, and then a final catch-all argument you can use the dotted pair notation, just like in <i>Scheme</i>.</p>
{{ [component :Nujel #nil
"[defn multiply-vals [val . l]
      [map l [fn [v] [* v val]]]]
[multiply-vals 2 1 2 3]
; => [2 4 6]"] }}

<h3>3. Defining a functions with any amount of arguments</h3>
<p>If you want to define a function that can take an arbitrary amount of arguments, you can just omit the brackets surrounding the argument list, this is just like you may be used from <i>Scheme</i>.</p>
{{ [component :Nujel #nil
"[defn my-list l l]
[my-list 1 2 3 4]
; => [1 2 3 4]"] }}

<h3>4. Documenting functions</h3>
<p>You can document your functions behaviour by having your functions start with a string literal (don't worry it will be optimized out of the final bytecode).</p>
<p>Adding multiple string literals to the beginning results in the docstring being all strings joined by a linebreak, this makes it easier to add multi-line docstrings.</p>
<p>In order to look up the docstring for any given function (even built-in ones) you can use the <code>[describe]</code> function </p>
{{ [component :Nujel #nil
"[defn double [α]
      \"Return α multiplied by 2\"
      [* 2 α]]
[double 2] ; => 4"] }}

<h3>5. Function decorators</h3>
<p>In order to tell the compiler some additional information about the function you are declaring, you can add keywords to the beginning of your function body.</p>
<p>Right now we only support <code>:export</code> and <code>:export-as</code>, <code>:inline</code> also exists but is still very buggy. More are very likely to follow though.</p>
{{ [component :Nujel #nil
"[defn double [α]
      :inline
      \"Return α multiplied by 2\"
      [* 2 α]]
[double 2] ; => 4
;; Doesn't really make much difference here, but helps especially with some simple predicates like [zero?]"] }}
