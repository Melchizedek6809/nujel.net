<h1>Parentheses</h1>
<p>Nujel uses the S-Expression notation as used by languages such as <i>Lisp</i>, <i>Scheme</i> and <i>Clojure</i>, but with one difference: Nujel defaults to using brackets instead of parentheses. This is mainly because brackets are much easier to type with a default US keyboard layout. You can still use parentheses if you must, since the two are completely interchangeable.</p>
{{ [component :Nujel #nil
"[+ 1 2] ; => 3
(+ 1 2) ; => 3"] }}

<p>Dotted pairs are also supported:</p>
{{ [component :Nujel #nil
"[car '[a . b]] ; => a
[cdr '[a . b]] ; => b
[car [cons 1 2]] ; => 1
[cdr [cons 1 2]] ; => 2"] }}
<p>And as you can see Nujel uses <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> to access the first or rest parts of lists. To build a new pair you can use <code>cons</code>.</p>
