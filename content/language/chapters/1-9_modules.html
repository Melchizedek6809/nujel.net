<h1>Modules - <warning-text>unstable</warning-text></h1>
<p>The Nujel module system is mostly modeled after ES6 Modules</p>

<h2>Expected changes</h2>
<p>The exact forms used for import/export might change, as well as exact error messages/keywords.</p>

<h2>No single/shared namespace</h2>
<p>In Nujel there is no single/shared namespace, so there is no way to reference a particular value without importing it first.</p>

<h2>Every symbol needs to be explicitly imported before usage</h2>
<p>Of course everything in <code>:core</code> is available by default, but apart from that everything needs to be requested explicitly. This should make upgrading much simpler since modules can provide incompatible functionality under a different symbol.</p>

<h2>Only way to import all symbols from another module is by requesting every export as a map</h2>
<p>This is a way of importing everything from a module, without the possibility of inadvertently shadowing symbols</p>
