<h1>Variables</h1>
<p>Variables in Nujel work like in most dynamically-typed languages, nothing too suprising here.</p>

<h3>1. Defining variables</h3>
<p>You can define new variables using <code>def</code> and give old variables a new value using <code>set!</code>.</p>
{{ (component :Nujel #nil
"my-temp ; You can access a variables value by evaluating the symbol
:unbound-variable

(def my-temp 123) ; Of course it needs to be defined first
123

my-temp
123") }}

<h3>2. Setting variables</h3>
<p>If you wish to change the value already associated with a given symbol, you can use <code>set!</code> to achieve that.</p>
{{ (component :Nujel #nil
"(def my-temp 123) ; Gotta define it first before we can use set!
(set! my-temp 234)
my-temp
234") }}

<h3>3. Let blocks</h3>
<p>You can use <code>let</code> to create a new context for assignments, you still have access to all symbols defined in parent contexts.</p>
<box-wrap box-color="red">
    <h3>Warning</h3>
    <p>Currently you can shadow already defined variables, this is highly discouraged and will probably become an error in later Nujel versions. This is because it has already led to some bugs and makes some optimizations more complicated.</p>
</box-wrap>
<p>Unlike most other Lisps using <code>let</code> is discouraged in most situations, since you can just use <code>def</code> within a function call in order to define temporary variables, it is available though and should work like in <i>Scheme</i> or <i>CL</i>.</p>
{{ (component :Nujel #nil
"(let ((new-temp 123))
     (println new-temp)) ; => 123
new-temp
:unbound-variable") }}
