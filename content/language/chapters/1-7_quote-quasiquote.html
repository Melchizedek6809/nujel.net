<h1>Quote / Quasiquote</h1>
<p>Quote works as you would expect, quasiquote however uses the clojure syntax for <code>unquote</code>/<code>unquote-splicing</code>. This is because I want to be able to treat <code>,</code> as white-space (it also looks very similar to a period, which I dislike).</p>
<pre class="source source-nujel">
'a ; You can quote symbols
; => a

'[1 2 3] ; Or lists
; => [1 2 3]

'(1 2 3) ; With parentheses or brackets
; => [1 2 3]

`[1 2 ~[+ 1 1 1]] ; To unquote you can use a tilde
; => [1 2 3]

`[1 ~@[list 2 3]] ; And ~@ for unquote-splicing
; => [1 2 3]
